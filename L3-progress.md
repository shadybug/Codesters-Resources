## Create a new Codesters project with the following requirements:
1. There is a list of names and a list of grades.
2. Print to the console each student’s name and grade by using an index variable to
access each element in the list.
3. Ask the user for a student number (location in the list), then print out that
student’s name and grade.
    - Make sure that the student number is valid. An error message should be
printed if the student number is not valid.
## Debug the following Scratch program: [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/32222440/](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/32222440/)
1. Debug this program and fix the code so it is working correctly.
    - The program should take in grades for classes and output the GPA (grade
point average) of all the classes.
## Create a new Codesters project with the following requirements:
1. Using a turtle sprite, draw 10 lines of random length.
2. Each line should be in a different random location.
3. Each line should be pointing in a different random direction.
4. The turtle should not draw between lines.
## Create a new Codesters project with the following requirements:
1. 2 sprites:
    - One controlled by the player with key events.
    - One randomly moving around the screen.
2. If the player sprite collides with the other sprite, a score variable should be
increased by 1 and the other sprite should immediately move to a new location.
3. Once the score is above 10, the other sprite should stop moving and the game
should end.
## Create a new Scratch project
1. Design a small animation or game
    - Decide what sprites you want to use
    - Decide what each sprite should do
2. Create your project.
