# Codesters Challenges 
## Part 1
- Create a variable “x” with a value of 10.
- Get a sprite and a background.
- Make the sprite move to 3 different positions. For an extra challenge, make the positions random.
- Print out “Hello world!” to the console.
- Print out your variable “x” to the console.
- Print out the x and y coordinate of the sprite in the console.
- Print out the numbers 1 through 10 to the console. Hint: Use a loop

## Part 2
- Make the sprite always go to the mouse pointer. (Hint: try commenting out your code instead of deleting it!)
- Add in another sprite that goes to a new random position every 2 seconds. Every time it moves it should print out its new location in the console.
- Add in the functionality to check if the sprites hit one another. If they hit each other, one of them should say “ouch”.
- Add in a variable that keeps track of how many times the sprites have hit each other.
- If the sprites have hit each other 10 times, they should stop moving and text saying game over should appear on the screen.

## Part 3
- Get a number input from the user and print it out to the console with the text “ Number: “.
- Add in a display so that there is always text on the screen displaying the number of times that the sprites have hit one another. 
- Get a number input from the user and check if it is even or odd. If it is even print out "even number". Otherwise, print out "odd number".
- You’re done! Is there anything else you want to add?
